### What's Missing

**UI Elements:**

- [ ] Recording source selection modal
- [ ] Recording controls overlay

**Functionality:**
- [ ] Actual video file import (currently visual only)
- [ ] Video playback (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Timeline playback sync
- [ ] Auto-import recorded videos

**Polish:**
- [ ] State persistence to local files
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Tooltips
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error handling UI

### Current Capabilities

**Working:**
- ✅ Beautiful, professional UI
- ✅ Timeline editing (drag, trim, split)
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Video processing infrastructure
- ✅ Export service architecture
- ✅ Recording service architecture

**Ready to Connect:**
- 🔌 FFmpeg to Timeline
- 🔌 Media import to Zustand
- 🔌 Player to Timeline state
- 🔌 Recording to Media Library
- 🔌 Export to file system

### Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Connect Real Video Import** - Make file import functional
2. **Implement Video Playback** - Connect player to actual videos
3. **Add Export Modal** - Build export UI with options
4. **Add Recording UI** - Build recording modal and controls
5. **State Persistence** - Save/load projects
6. **Polish & Testing** - Add all remaining UI polish

### Technical Debt

- No actual video processing yet (visual-only)
- Timeline clips are dummy data
- Player doesn't play real videos
- No file I/O implementation
- Recording service needs UI integration

### Conclusion

ClipForge MVP has a **solid foundation** with all major systems in place. The architecture is complete and well-structured. The next phase is connecting the services together to make it fully functional with real video processing.

**Status:** Foundation Complete - Ready for Integration Phase
