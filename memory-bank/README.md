# Memory Bank - ClipForge

The Memory Bank contains essential project documentation that helps me (Cursor AI) maintain context across sessions. These files serve as my "institutional memory" for this project.

## Structure

### Core Files

1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document defining the project's vision, goals, scope, and success criteria
2. **productContext.md** - Why this project exists, problems it solves, how it works, and user experience goals
3. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus, recent changes, active decisions, and next steps
4. **systemPatterns.md** - System architecture, design patterns, technical decisions, and component relationships
5. **techContext.md** - Technology stack, development setup, configuration, and deployment details
6. **progress.md** - What works, what's left to build, known issues, and current status

## Purpose

This Memory Bank enables:
- **Consistent Context**: Understanding the project state and decisions even after memory resets
- **Informed Decisions**: Making architectural choices based on established patterns
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into what's been completed and what remains
- **Onboarding**: New contributors (or future AI sessions) can quickly understand the project

## How It Works

```
Project Context → Memory Bank → AI Decision Making
     ↓                ↓              ↓
PRD, Code     projectbrief.md    Helpful
Task List     systemPatterns.md  Responses
Decisions     techContext.md     to Users
```

## When to Update

Update these files when:
1. Major features are completed
2. Architecture patterns are established
3. Technical decisions are made
4. Significant progress is achieved
5. User explicitly requests "update memory bank"

## Access Pattern

The AI reads these files at the start of each session to:
- Understand project goals and constraints
- Apply established patterns and conventions
- Make informed architectural decisions
- Track progress toward completion

**Note**: This directory contains Markdown files that are meant to be read by the AI assistant (Cursor) to maintain context about this project across different coding sessions.
