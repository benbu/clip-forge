# Progress: ClipForge

## Current Status: ðŸŸ¢ Post-MVP â€” Epic 4 (Export & Delivery) In Progress

**Overall Progress**: ~92% Complete
**Epic 4**: Export queue, presets, summary, validation shipped; cross-platform QA + automation pending
**Epic 3**: Waveform extraction/visualization delivered; focusing next on zoom/minimap + navigation polish

## What Works

### Infrastructure
- âœ… Basic Electron application launches
- âœ… Main process entry point (`src/main/main.js`)
- âœ… Package.json configured with Electron
- âœ… Development script (`npm start`)

### Documentation
- âœ… PRD and task lists kept current
- âœ… Memory Bank updated for Epic 4 export delivery

## What's in Progress

### Currently Building
- Timeline zoom/minimap UX polish and keyboard shortcuts
- Cross-platform regression pass (export queue + waveform hydration)
- Playwright automation plan for export regression

## What's Left to Build

### Timeline & Editing (Epic 3)
- [ ] Audio waveform rendering with peak caching and per-clip gain controls
- [ ] Timeline zoom/minimap + keyboard navigation improvements
- [ ] Performance profiling + virtualization strategy for large projects

### Recording Enhancements (Epic 1 follow-up)
- [ ] PiP overlay placement refinements (presets + drag handles)
- [ ] Audio routing presets + input monitoring polish
- [ ] Cross-platform QA of recording flows alongside new export pipeline

### Export & Delivery Follow-Ups (Epic 4 completion)
- [ ] Cross-platform regression suite for export queue (Playwright automation)
- [ ] Expand preset library w/ saved templates & docs
- [ ] Gather beta feedback on summary workflow and iterate

### Stretch / Post-MVP
- [ ] Undo/redo stack
- [ ] Project save/load workflow
- [ ] Text overlays, transitions, advanced audio mixing

## Feature Completion Status

### Core Features
- [x] Import media files with metadata and thumbnails
- [x] Media library with sorting, filters, detail drawer
- [x] Video preview player (UI)
- [x] Timeline editor with drag/trim/split
- [x] Screen recording (service layer)
- [x] Export to MP4 (service layer)
- [x] Export queue with presets, summary review, telemetry, validation (Epic 4)
- [x] Waveform extraction queue + timeline visualization with gain controls (Epic 3)

### Nice-to-Have Features (Stretch)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Undo/Redo
- [ ] Project save/load
- [ ] Audio controls (volume, fade)
- [x] Text overlays
- [ ] Transition effects
- [ ] Auto-save

## Known Issues

- Cross-platform QA for new export queue pending (verify reveal-in-folder + shell bridges on Windows/Linux)
- Waveform queue needs additional persistence for very large assets (>50MB) and Windows path edge cases
- Video playback of real files is pending integration

## Technical Debt

- Need a typed IPC map and runtime validation wrappers
- Export job metadata lacks persistent storage; consider persisting queue history for diagnostics
- No persistent cache for waveform peaks (regenerated each session)

## Performance Metrics

### Target vs. Current
- **Launch Time**: Target <5s, Current: N/A (not implemented)
- **Playback FPS**: Target 30+, Current: N/A (not implemented)
- **Timeline Response**: Target 10+ clips responsive, Current: N/A (not implemented)
- **Export Speed**: Target 2min clip in <30s, Current: N/A (not implemented)
- **Memory Usage**: Target <1GB, Current: N/A (not implemented)

## Testing Status

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: limited (core stores only) â€” expansion required
- **Integration Tests**: export queue + waveform automation pending (Playwright planned)
- **E2E Tests**: smoke plan drafted, blocked on waveform UI polish

### Test Platform Coverage
- Windows: Manual sanity pending (queue + waveform hydration)
- macOS: Primary dev platform (manual QA ongoing)
- Linux: Pending queue/waveform regression sweep

## Deployment Status

- **Packaging**: Not configured
- **Build Scripts**: Basic only
- **Installer**: Not created
- **Auto-Update**: Not implemented
- **Code Signing**: Not configured

## Milestones

### Completed Milestones
1. âœ… Project Planning & Documentation

### Upcoming Milestones

   - Complete architecture setup
   - All tools configured
   - Basic window rendering

2. **MVP UI** (Target: End of Week 2)
   - Media library functional
   - Video player operational
   - Timeline visible

3. **MVP Editing** (Target: End of Week 3)
   - Drag-and-drop working
   - Trimming functional
   - FFmpeg integrated

4. **MVP Recording** (Target: End of Week 4)
   - Screen capture working
   - Webcam recording working
   - Recordings import to library

5. **MVP Complete** (Target: End of Week 5)
   - Export functional
   - Packaged executables
   - Demo complete

## Overall Assessment

The project has excellent documentation and planning in place, but implementation has just begun. The foundation needs to be laid before feature development can proceed. The next critical step is setting up the complete development environment with TypeScript, Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 - Foundation Setup by configuring the development environment and creating the complete project structure.
