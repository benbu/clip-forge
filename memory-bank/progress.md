## Overall Assessment

The project has excellent documentation and planning in place, but implementation has just begun. The foundation needs to be laid before feature development can proceed. The next critical step is setting up the complete development environment with TypeScript, Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 - Foundation Setup by configuring the development environment and creating the complete project structure.
